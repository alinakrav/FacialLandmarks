basically I googled 'facial landmark detection', found an API on pyimagesearch.com, got the source code, and now i'm combining the alignment function and the facial landmark detection functions to output images of just the landmarks. I'm hoping to use this for facial comparison between images to find how similar two faces are to each other in their features or type.
